HISTORY

Before the transistor was invented, computers used vacuum tubes. 
Those tubes however where very prone to errors and failures. 
In this game you are tasked with maintaining different of these computers. 
You need to change tubes until there is nothing more to maintain. 
Computers were very high maintenance, especially in these times, 
and especially the six women who were programming and maintaining the ENIAC 
could tell you that.
